This beta release updates Dispatch's HttpClient dependency to 4.1
final, and adds support for the NIO [HttpAsyncClient][async].

[async]: http://hc.apache.org/httpcomponents-asyncclient-dev/index.html

There are now four standard varieties of http executors available in
different modules:

    dispatch.Http
    dispatch.nio.Http
    dispatch.thread.Http
    dispatch.gae.Http

Typical usage would be:

    import dispatch._
    val http = new nio.Http

The `Http` object is no longer accessible from all modules, so the
implicit conversions that were found there are now in `Request`.

`Request` itself has been substantially refactored. It is now only a
class with properties and a copy method. All of the request-building
operations ("verbs") are added via implicit conversions, putting the
core module on the same plane as internal and external extension
modules.

One change that is likely to break a lot of client code (sorry!) is
the `<<` and `<<?` verbs which previously took a `Map[String, Any]`
now take an `Iterable[(String, String)]`. So you can still use a Map
if you like, it just has to be a map of strings to strings or you'll
get compilation errors. The more permissive typing, which made use of
`Any#toString`, was the source of common errors in application code
where non-trivial objects (often, functions) were unknowingly added.

###Callbacks and futures

The `thread` and `nio` executors return stoppable futures from their
`apply` and other request executions, allowing persistent connections
to be easily closed. A new alternative to request handlers is
`dispatch.Callback`, which defines a callback function to receive
request data as it arrives. For example, the fundamental response
callback accepting bytes:

    h(:/("example.com") ^ (response, bytes, length) => { ... } )

There are more convenient callbacks that convert the bytes to strings,
and buffer them into single lines:

    h(:/("example.com") ^-- println)

You can also return a value from the stoppable future produced, by
defining a finishing function:

    h(:/("example.com") ^-- println ^> { res => "all done!" })

But if what you want is a finished response object, it's much easier
to just use the standard response handlers. These work with the NIO
interface by buffering the response in memory. So this works with any
of the executors:

    import dispatch.liftjson.Js._
    h(:/("example.com") ># { js => ... })

With the `thread` and `nio` executors, the current thread continues
while the request is performed in a background or IO thread. The
handler function is called with the completed request object (in this
case a JValue) as soon as it is available.

The [080 branch][twine] of the twine example application uses the new
stoppable callback interface with an NIO executor to connect to
Twitter [User Streams](http://dev.twitter.com/pages/user_streams).
