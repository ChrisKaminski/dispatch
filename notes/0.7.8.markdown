Http
----

Uses `Source.fromInputStream` for `>~` instead of loading stream into
a String first (it's a long story).
  
OAuth
-----

Transfers oauth_callback in header (with all other OAuth parameters)
rather than post method body. The consumer-only signing application of
the `<@` operator is now deprecated. ([softprops][softprops])

Interfaces
----------

* Meetup: Added support for the Open Events method.
* Twitter: Added a UserStream interface (sans Json schema for now)

Twine
-----

Updated to work from its [own repository][twine], and also to use UserStream.
