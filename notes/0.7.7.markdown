This release introduces an **Amazon S3** interface.

The `aws-s3` module provides basic support for interacting with
Amazon's S3 service. It supplies Dispatch handlers that sign requests
in accordance with the [S3 authentication specifications][1] and a
convenience class for interacting with S3 Buckets.  See the
[module README][readme] for more information.
