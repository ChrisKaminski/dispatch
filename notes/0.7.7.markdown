Amazon S3 module
----------------
The `aws-s3` module provides basic support for interacting with Amazon's
S3 service by providing additional handlers which sign the HTTP
request in accordance with the [S3 authentication specifications][1].  
The module also provides a convenience class for interacting with S3
Buckets.  See the [README][readme] for details.
