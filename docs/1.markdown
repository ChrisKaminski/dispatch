Dispatch
========

*Dispatch* is a Scala library for accessing HTTP services. Beneath the
surface it uses the battle-tested Apache [HttpClient][hc] library in
its thread-blocking or NIO variants, your choice.  On the surface
it's a vocabulary for expressing HTTP requests and how you want to
handle them, in pure and unconstrained Scala.
