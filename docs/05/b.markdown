Response Bodies
---------------

Request definitions, by themselves, are not enough information for
Dispatch to do its job. The response that the server returns may have
no body at allâ€”or it could contain too much data to hold in memory.

Before Dispatch makes a request, then, you must tell it how to handle
the server's response. For this we have *handlers*. Handlers are
created from request definitions using handler verbs. Taking up the
request defined on the last page, we could simply ignore the response.

```scala
val ignore = learnScala >|
```

This would be very unusual for a GET request in particular, which
shouldn't have any side effects. (It's also not speaking well of our
commitment to learning Scala.)
